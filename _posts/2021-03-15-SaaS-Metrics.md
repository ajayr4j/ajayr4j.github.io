title: SaaS Metrics to look in a Startup/Company
---

SaaS

A company can become successfull only if many factors align like people, culture, product, customer success, sales, etc., unless some company shoots up due to some magical USP. But, For an investor or someone who is evaluating company all the above factors are kindof intangible for them. So, I'm adding here all the metrics an investor/evaluator will look at. **Metrics** is something that will bring out the truth about any company, afterall math won't let you down. If you're looking to join, invest or buy a company this would definitely come in handy. All the informations is gathered from Medium, Youtube, SaaS articles etc.,

# Some Abbrevations:

| LTV   - Customer Lifetime Value                             |
| Churn - Move out of the company(Dollar, Customer, Employee) |
| CV    - Customer value                                      |
| ACL   - Average customer lifespan                           |
| APF   - Average purchase frequency                          |
| APV   - Average purchase value                              |
| CRO   - Conversion rate optimization                        |
| ARR   - Annual Recurring Revenue                            |
| CAC   - Cusomter acquisition cost                           |
| VAR   - Value added reseller                                |
| VSB   - Very small business                                 |

# Some Formulae

- CAC = Total marketing and sales expenses($) / Total number of new customers acquired
  - Expenses that are covered for marketing and sales: Ad Spend, Employee Salaries, Creative Costs, Technical Costs, Publishing Costs, Production Costs and Maintaiing Inventory
- APV = Divide total revenue / Number of purchases 
- APF = Number of purchases / Number of unique customers
- CV = APV x APF
- ACL = Number of years a customer continues purchasing
- LTV = CV x ACL
- Net new ARR = New ARR + Existing ARR - Churned ARR

*Ideally all the above calculations are made for the course of a year*

# Some Pattern

All the below points are analysed over the period of 20 years, designed as a guess or method to make a conclusive statement about the company's health. So, there are always very niche market that won't fit in this. But, this should fit for the most case. Some cases that are below won't work for seed stage startups, but it's good to make these comparisions in a timeseries graph than making these calculations from a single point of time to see the trajectory more clearly.

- LTV:CAC = 3:1, Because if the LTV is as nearly as CAC(1:1) then it's a clear case of burning out or a slow exit if it's 2:1 and if the ratio is 5:1, then there is an oppurtunity to invest more in CAC as the company might loose out potential customers if not done.
- LTV > 3 X CAC 
- Months to recover the spent CAC < 12-18 months(Important for Capital Efficiency)
- With the LTV:CAC draw a comparison between the VAR and VSB segment, which ever has a better ratio invest sales force towards that
- Churn rate per month should be less than 20%
- Customer Success:
  - Negative Churn = Revenue from existing customers > Revenue lost from churning customers
  - Analyise customer feedback, tickets related to them 
- Cusomer Churn vs Dollar Churn:
  - This metric should be analysed, invest sales and marketing resources into the type of client that brings in good amount of money, than 
- The product should be repeatable, scalable and profitable 
- Due diligence of the IP - Both legal and authenticity from tech perspective
- Rule of the 40 - Growth rate and profit margin should be greater than 40% combined
